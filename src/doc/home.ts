                    ivy considers templates as objects associated to a render 
                    function that are defined in a tagged template string that 
                    will be transformed into <strong> typescript instructions at 
                    compilation time </>

                <p>
                    ivy's mental model is to read the template syntax as a 
                    <strong> sequence of JavaScript statements </> that can 
                    be easily mixed with other statements and that 
                    allow to implement efficient

                    with ivy calling sub-templates or re-factoring code into 
                    sub- parametric templates has never been so easy. All that is 
                    needed is to have the template identifier accessible in the template 
                    function JS scope and call the sub-template through a custom element 
                    with the <strong> * prefix </> (ivy defines multiple special elements 
                    this is why a prefix was chosen over a naming convention like for JSX)
                </>
                <p>
                    note: as the template identifier is a local variable, it can also 
                    be <strong> passed as template argument </> and 
                    <strong> can be changed dynamically! </>.

                <p> 
                    note: to keep the syntax simple. ivy only exposes a few 
                    <a href="#/examples/loops"> statements </>
                    that need to be <strong> prefixed with the !$ symbol </> so that

                    (in our case the HTML DOM). This is why ivy introduces

                    note: ivy also ensures that content nodes or sub-templates are not

                    components are very powerful tools to combine parametric blocks 
                    to generate HTML content. However, they come short to help combine 
                    multiple behaviors or non-graphical logic. This why ivy introduces 
                    <a href="#/api/decorators"> decorators </>
                    (also sometimes called <strong> directives </>) to solve this kind

                <p>
                    in ivy, decorators can have 0 to n parameters and can be either

                    (i.e. interpreted by the ivy compiler) or <strong>custom</>

                    to be imported in the template JS scope).

                    when the HTML DOM is rendered, there are often cases where 
                    we need to <strong> get a references to some of the generated elements </>
                    in order to perform dynamic operations (like setting the focus on

                    large applications often require to serve dynamic content retrieved 
                    from a CMS. In this case, the ideal solution is to be able to 
                    <strong> combine html content with custom template components </>

                    with templates compiled into JS code at build time, this requirement is 
                    very hard
                    to support in a simple manner. This is why ivy supports a 
                    <strong> second kind of templates </> called 
                    <a href="#/examples/fragment1"> $fragments </>. This templates are

                    last but not least, ivy also supports the possibility to 
                    run <strong> pre-processors</>. These 
                    pre-processors are special kind of decorators (with the 
                    double @ prefix) that are called by the XJS parser and that can 
                    modify the XJS parsing result (aka. AST) at compilation time.

                <p>
                    a very common use case for pre-processors is to inject content
